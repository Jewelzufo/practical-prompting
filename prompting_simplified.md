## What is a prompt?
At it's simplest, a prompt is a set of instructions given to a Large Language Model (LLM) written in natural language (text). 

A *concise* and *clear* prompt instructing the model on how to achieve your **defined goal** has a significant impact on the responses.

## Step 1: Defining Your Objective

Knowing your end goal before writing your prompt is often overlooked. By defining your goal (e.g. *I want to learn the basics of Python lists and indexes*), you can craft your prompts around them!

Over time this will will help you craft progressively better prompts! With practice, you will begin to develop your own ways to prompt for your use case.

## Step 2: Basic Prompt Elements

### Context
Providing adequate `context` in your prompt is critical to achieving desired responses. 
- Include background info and relevant information. 

```markdown
Context: I am a beginner learning Python programming. 
```

## Role
Assigning a `role` to the LLM encourages the model to roleplay as a specialist *( Data Analyst, Cybersecurity Specialist Project Manager, etc.)*

```markdown
Context: I am a beginner learning Python programming.

Role: You are an experienced Python educator who explains complex topics, in simple ways.
```

## Task
`Task` informs the model what you are asking it to do. 

**Complete Prompt(Simplified)**

```markdown 
Context: I am a beginner learning Python programming.

Role: You are an experienced Python educator who explains complex topics, in simple ways.

Task: Explain the basics of lists and indexes.
```

## Conclusion:
This is the minimum knowledge needed to start using LLMs effectively to increase productivity in your life! 

Having a clearly defined end result helps significantly when crafting a prompt. 

Document which prompts work well and try experimenting to achieve progressively better results.
